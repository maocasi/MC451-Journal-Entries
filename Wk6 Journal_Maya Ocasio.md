# Wk. 6: Narrowing the Topic Field

**Date:** 02/20/26
**Approach Used:** Connector

## Reflection:

This week's lecture on Ch.6: The Project Brief, discussed how we can scale our project and study for the semester, especially by ensuring that our research topic isn't too broad. For my particular topic with  YouTube thumbnails, hope was to narrow a designed format within media that isn't too wide in scale and can also be broken down into the elements that relate to its impact on media consumers. For our research topic we also have to ensure that we are following similar lines to that of the "Holy Trinity of Research Design" which includes our topic, the theory we are connecting it to within media, and the data sources that we are using toe explain our topic. This chapter will be useful for me to reference back now that we are finalizing the beginnings of our research. This can also help me ensure that I always have these three areas covered/in mind as I continue to gather sources and discover new findings for my research topic.
