# Wk. 1- Learning New Softwares

**Date:** 01/16/26
**Approach Used:** Troubleshooter
## Reflection:

I was pretty nervous to start MC451 Research Methods in Mass Media. I know this class will be pretty software and data heavy and that was something that initially overwhelmed me (still does, actually). What was most difficult for me this week was preparing for these first assignments that were due as I was absent from our class time on Wednesday. Downloading Github, Obsidian, and learning the basics of how to operate them both on my own did seem like a lot at first. When it came to solving this issue I really just had to remind myself that I am completely new to these software's and so that it is okay to make mistakes.

I walked through each step carefully and did have to reference back to the recorded Yuja lecture to get the hang of some of the steps. All of this came down to dedicating the time to understand the basics and the requirements that we were supposed to meet. The fact alone that I can read this on my Github page is a reflection of some of the progress that I have made this week as I had never used either of these software's before this class. I'm proud that I have been able to take these first steps, and although there is still much I have to get the hang of through Obsidian and Github facing the setup process this week is giving me that initial practice with something that we will be using throughout the rest of the semester.
