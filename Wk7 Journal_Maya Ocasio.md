# Wk. 7: Asynchrounus Work Week

**Date:** 02/27/26
**Approach Used:** Critic
## Reflection:

The assumption this week from our reading material that stuck out to me was our topic from Ch.7— structured listening. This chapter reminded me a lot of a concept I learned of in my second year of college called **ethnographic research**. Structured listening from my understanding really seems to be the qualitative side of our research where we can observe our chosen media that we are looking into for our research project and pick up on patterns and behaviors that will hep give better insight into our research questions. The areas of what to document that are recommended in our chapter seem like they will align well when I am observing visual patterns on YouTube (especially because visual patterns serve as a way to communicate within this social platform). Logging my "field" notes in an observation log and tracking certain patterns that I pick up on within YouTube can be useful when it comes to comparing that data to that of the research and information that I learn from journal articles and research studies that I find.
