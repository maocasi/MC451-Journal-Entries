# Wk. 2- Understanding Our Workspaces for the Semester

**Date:** 01/22/2026
**Approach Used:** Connector
**Phase:** Orientation
## Reflection:

Although we only met for class on Wednesday this week, we discussed Ch. 2- The Publishing Engine. In this chapter we learned the importance of having data that can be both reproducible, accessible, readable, and flows together for the community or individuals that you are trying to share it with. When it comes to the research and deliverables aspects of our project that will be coming up later in the semester this introductory information is important to keep in mind as I will have to step into that role of being the person that is delivering data and research. We also learned more of the functions and purposes that some of the tools we will be using throughout the semester will serve in order for us to achieve this is as a researcher (R Studio, Quarto, Git, etc.).

A topic I related to was the one on "Overcoming Coding Anxiety". As we talked about in class, hearing the word coding automatically makes one want to associate it with math which can be daunting at first when you don't consider yourself much of a math person. I appreciated being reminded that coding isn't always math and that it can also be seen as a language—in which you can learn as you go to build skills that will eventually becoming easier as you continue to use and practice them.
