# Wk. 5: Zotero & Developing Theories

**Date:** 02/13/26
**Approach Used:** Connector
## Reflection:

This week we discussed in greater detail that elements and methods that take place during research. We discussed theories like agenda setting, framing, uses and gratifications to understand the different approaches that can be made when a study is conducted (which will be beneficial in the process of reading journal articles and papers throughout the semester to see what approach the researchers/scholars took). Along with the applications of theories and its relevant terms (independent and dependent variables, moderators), we went over the application Zotero which will be one method that we can use over the semester to store our notes and annotations that make from the sources that we gather. I have only annotated one research study article on zotero so far, but I am liking the application so far. There are still some technicalities and settings I'm still unsure of on the app/software, but I have gotten the basics down when it comes to having annotated copies of my sources and tagging relevant ideas which will be beneficial when it comes to reach the finalizing processes of my semester project.
