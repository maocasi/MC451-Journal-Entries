# Wk. 3- The Ways of Knowing: 

**Date:** 01/30/26
**Approach Used:** Critic

## Reflection:

One of the topics that intrigued me from our lecture this week was when we discussed epistemology. I had not known previously that knowledge or where it comes from can be broken into so many different categories (tenacity, empiricism, etc.). Questions like: Are experts truly the most well-knowing in their field?, really make you think of the different kinds of knowledge people can have and, as we discussed, the strengths and weaknesses of each. I feel that of all of them empiricism may be the most reliable, but it does have the weakness of taking time to collecting information.  Every piece of information and facts we hear about the world around us are all based on one of the forms of knowledge that we discussed. Taking the recent storm for example: a family member could say they have a gut feeling about the roads being really bad before it has even started snowing (intuition) and, at the same time, the meteorologist could say that they expect them to be not great due to weather data (authority)...these are both different forms of knowledge that draw the same conclusion. Yet, the very same can happen when facts and ideas divide us or when we are in disagreement.
