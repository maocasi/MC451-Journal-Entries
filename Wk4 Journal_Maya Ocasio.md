# Wk. 4: Intelligence Gathering & Research

**Date:** 02/06/26
**Approach Used:** Troubleshooter
## Reflection:

This week we looked more into intelligence gathering and looked at some of the databases that we can use for our research coming up in the semester. One of the important topics that we discussed this week was boolean operators. Booleans allow use to tailor searches that we make while researching to curate search results more towards our particular areas of interest. This same week I used boolean operators such as "AND" for the purpose of finding relevant journal articles and research regarding my potential research topic for this class (How YouTube thumbnails are used within its platform and how the visual aesthetics of those videos generate interest and result in user interaction patterns on the platform). 

It was interesting to see how my search result numbers would increase and decrease depending on what I included through the boolean searches. This really did highlight what we discussed in class—on how some topics may be well researched and others not as looked into. This was definitely revealed when combining certain keywords together and seeing if they would be mentioned together within the same sources.
